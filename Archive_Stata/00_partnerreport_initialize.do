*  must be run each time Stata is opened
	/* Choose the project path location to where you want the project parent 
	   folder to go on your machine. Make sure it ends with a forward slash */
	global projectpath "C:\Users\nbartlett\Documents\GitHub"
	cd "$projectpath"
	
* Run a macro to set up study folder
	* Name the file path below
	local pFolder PartnerProgress
	foreach dir in `pFolder' {
		confirmdir "`dir'"
		if `r(confirmdir)'==170 {
			mkdir "`dir'"
			display in yellow "Project directory named: `dir' created"
			}
		else disp as error "`dir' already exists, not created."
		cd "$projectpath/`dir'"
		}
	* end

* Run initially to set up folder structure
* Choose your folders to set up as the local macro `folders'
	local folders RawData StataOutput ExcelOutput Documents ReportTemplate Reports
	foreach dir in `folders' {
		confirmdir "`dir'"
		if `r(confirmdir)'==170 {
				mkdir "`dir'"
				disp in yellow "`dir' successfully created."
			}
		else disp as error "`dir' already exists. Skipped to next folder."
	}
	*end
*Set up global file paths located within project path
	*these folders must exist in the parent folder
	global projectpath `c(pwd)'
	global data "$projectpath/RawData"
	global output "$projectpath/StataOutput"
	global graph "$projectpath/StataFigures"
	global excel "$projectpath/ExcelOutput"
	*this folders path is in a seperate file location due to data size and usage
	*you can change these directories to point to $data on your machine
	disp as error "If initial setup, move data to RawData folder."
